# Learnt
- **SVG** - XML based graphics language for 2-D figures
    > *SVG is to graphics, what Html is to text*
- To get an **underline for each letter** - make each letter a centered flex item with border-bottom
- If we send an array of elemnts as innerHtml, they get rendered as **comma separated** elements (used in case of wrong letters)
- If we check for innerText on the parent of bunch of elements, the returned text is **line separated** innerText of each child element. (so we have to replace the new lines)


# Scope for improvement
- Instead of hard-coding the words, we can fetch them from an array
